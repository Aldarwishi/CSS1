- Exploring HTML Basics

1: HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
